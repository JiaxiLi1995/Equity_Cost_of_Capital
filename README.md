# Equity Cost of Capital

It has been 23 years since Fama and French (1997) tried to estimate the industries' equity cost of capital (ECC). They have mentioned a few obstacles in the estimation of the ECC: Selection of Factor Model, Estimation of Factor Loadings, and Estimation of Factor Risk Premiums. We will review the literature about a better Factor Model and better Factor Loading estimation, and provide a possible way to improve the factor risk premium estimation.

[Here](https://github.com/JiaxiLi1995/Equity_Cost_of_Capital/blob/master/ECC.md) are the results.
